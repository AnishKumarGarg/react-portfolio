      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Anish Kumar Garg. I am a BE-Computer Science student at Chitkara Unversity Rajpura. I live in Chandigarh, India. My academic journey has been a thrilling adventure through algorithms, data structures, and software development. Every line of code I write is a step closer to realizing my vision of creating innovative solutions that make a positive impact on the world. Beyond my classroom, I believe in the power of practical experience. I've delved into various coding projects, both solo and collaborative, to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. At last I would like to say that I am one of the most determined, hardworking and competitive person be in academics or be it extra-curricular activities. Thank You ðŸ’œ",
